This game is still in development. I cannot provide too many details, but when the game is completed I will post more details on its development here. The game is being developed in the Unity engine.

Plot Summary: A brother and sister in the military must assemble a team of super powered individuals to fight terrorists hellbent on killing everyone with superpowers, all while the team tries to keep their own powers from killing themselves.

Gameplay Summary: The story will be told through a visual novel style, while the gameplay will take place on a turn-based on a hexagonal grid.
