This game is still in development. I cannot provide much detail, but when the game is completed I will post it here. To keep up with this game develpoment as well as my other sninanigans, be sure to check out my (hopefully) many posts. The game is being developed in the Unity engine.

Gameplay Summary: The story is told through a visual novel style with turn-based gameplay on a hexagonal grid.
