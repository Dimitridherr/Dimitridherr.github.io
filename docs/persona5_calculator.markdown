I am a huge fan of the persona franchise, so I of course have been looking for projects to contribute to. The first one I found was a tool used to calculate fusions in persona 5/5R. Before I typically just searched for a specific persona to see possible combinations. Having one tool to go to is nice!

The tool can be used <a href="https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/index.html#/list">here</a>.

The project source can be found <a href="https://github.com/chinhodado/persona5_calculator">here</a>.
