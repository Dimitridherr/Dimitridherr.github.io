This was a website made with a classmate for my college course on SQL. Its purpose was to provide users with a service similar to <a href="https://myanimelist.net/">My Anime List</a>, but for video games. Due to the class using a private SQL server provided by my university, it cannot work on its own. Another side-effect of using a private server only meant for a class is a lack of proper security built into our project, for this reason I will not be hosting my own SQL server to make it operatable as of now. This is a consideration for the future.
