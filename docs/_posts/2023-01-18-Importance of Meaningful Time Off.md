Despite some hardships from the pandemic and financial difficulties, I was able to earn my Bachelors in Computer Science! I accepted a job as an IT Specialist 2 for the applied research lab at Penn State, an institute that does research for the department of defense. While it isn't something I necessarily want to do long term and the pay is well below industry standard due to lack of competition in the area, I nonetheless see this as a great opportunity to grow and learn. Seeing as I am not privy to starting work immediately after graduating, I decided to set my start at the end of January to give myself a month to unwind and get things organized.

So far the time I have spent has been quite productive. I have been continuing to work on the game, made a video for an upcoming YouTube channel, semi-fixed my sleep schedule, and have just generally worked on improving my mental health. While it may have been a bad decision financially to not be working, I believe having some time to unwind is important for long-term success and mental health. Had I not spent this time investing in personal projects, I would never have learned more about video editing or game development.

The time I spent has further cemented my interest in pursuing game development, especially as I see it evolving towards a final product. The video I made, while certainly in need of improvement, has likewise reaffirmed my interest in creating more creative works for others to enjoy. My weakest area is certainly my presenting ability. My voice is, by default, quite monotonous. This means my presentation style can lack emotion or impact. Not helping this is my tendency to become quite anxious during presenting, especially when reading from a script. Nonetheless, creating my first video has helped me determine my starting point and has allowed me to lay out strategies to improve for the future.
