This is my first post on my website. It was interesting getting this to work, as I have never worked with Ruby or Jekyll before. I am going to try to post updates on my current projects and things I have learned. It has been a hot minute since I have worked with HTML/CSS so this will also be a great opportunity to polish those skills up. I doubt anyone will read this, but I suppose its good writing practice. I think for fun I will post a favorite image/meme of mine at the end of every post.
